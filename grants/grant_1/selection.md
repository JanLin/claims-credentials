# Winner Announcement

The Claims & Credential (C&C) Group at DIF is glad to announce Transmute Industries as the recipient of the first DIF Grant to provide a JWS Test Suite for Verifiable Credentials.
Transmute has been a thought leader in the SSI space for years and uniquely fits the requirement profile laid out in the Grant announcement.

1. Orie, CTO of Transmute is the initiating author and main contributor of the (LD-) JSON Web Signature 2020
2. Transmute has a strong background in TDD and is a strong proponent of delivering test vectors with specifications in order to achieve greater implementation-level interoperability. Examples include Test Vectors in Sidetree.js and did-key.js
3. The company already provides integrated libraries to support (LDS)-VC and JWT-VC side-by-side demonstrating their familiarity with both representations. See vc.js.
4. Lastly, Transmute has a strong track record of making specifications and libraries accessible to the general public in a variety of deployed web-projects (https://did.key.transmute.industries/, https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/ and others…)

Therefore we regard Transmute Industries as the ideal candidate to provide a comprehensive JWS test suite for LDS-VC and JWT-VC and support the community interactions around this project within DIF’s C&C Group.
