# Name of DIF member (organization or individual)
* Spruce Systems

### Are you a member of DIF?
* Yes

### Are you now a member of the C&C WG? If not, would you be willing to join if chosen for this grant? 
* Yes

## The selection criteria for the work item lead is as follows:

* familiarity with JWS mechanics and common JOSE libraries/best-practices
* experience with automated testing, vector design, and test scripts/suites
* familiarity with LD Proofs and signature suites generally
* familiarity with JSON/JSON-LD interop problems, at the semantic, signature-verification, and representation/parsing levels

### Qualifications as per the criteria above
* We have worked extensively with JWT, JWS, and JWE envelopes and systems and work with many variations of these for both VC- and non-VC use cases
* We have based our internal CI/CD process on the test suites of DID-core, VC-WG, and VC-HTTP-API, all three of which we contribute to
* We are authors of signature suites, both in LDP- and non-LDP traditions
* We work on interoperability and translation/cross-representation issues with some regularity, and participate actively in many WGs and other standards contexts to expose ourselves to more of these than client work surfaces
