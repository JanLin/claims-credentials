## Meeting - 10th December 2021 - ESSIF-LAB Consent Record Demo 
<detail><summary>Description:</summary>
Data Agreement demoes from NGI ESSIF-LAB sub-grantees iGrant.io, Gataca and the Human Colossus Foundation. These three demo'd implementations demonstrate how a consent notice (or "data agreement" as it was called in the ESSIF-LAB context) gets signed as a shared record between issuers/verifiers (data controllers) and holders (data subjects). The data agreement sets a clear purpose of usage, what personal data is collected, how long data can be retained and on what lawful basis it can be processed; both parties keep a record, allowing precise GDPR enforcement and transparency on all sides. 

The data agreement was originally based on the Kantara Initiative's Consent Notice, which is now being standardized as a new ISO standard 27560. All DIF members are welcome to the demo to better understand what data agreements are and how it has was implemented using VC technology by the NGI essif-lab participants.  The meeting will be recorded and archived as a meeting of the Claims & Credentials WG.

3. Juan stepping up as C&C chair?
    - notes are 100% better with Juan here
5. [WG Participation Tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=0)
6. Workitem Status: JWS Test Suite [notes](https://hackmd.io/WtOeBNQfRmye7FrjYjNI3g)
8. Workitem Status: WACI-PEX - off this week, swift progress on Issuance extension
    - Blocked by BBS+ AppCry (sig suite) and implementation (Mattr, danyam)
        - RDF canonicalization panicking at blank nodes; blank nodes also leaky of info, in the opinion of the JWP group at AppCry WG and others (not just number of blanks against schema, but also how unique IDs are assigned to blank nodes from their k/v names)
    - Martin: exact relationship to BBS+? Sine qua non? Brent: No, the BBS+ was always planned as the first of many ZKP profiles to be defined and targetted... other ZKPs might come soon, there are people working on the item working on/familiar with multiple ZKP systems
    - Possibility of intermediate goal (e.g. using LD Framing without BBS+)
10. Workitem Status: PE (2.0) + Credential Manifest
    - OIDC input largely incorporated on PE; they're starting on CM (pre-v1) now;
        - Martin: How much of the v2-v1 diff come from the OIDC group? Brent: I wanna say 3/4? Much of what they requested actually ended up with very few breaking/normative changes, a few MUSTs becoming SHOULDs and vice versa; also greatly informed the PE<>CM division of labor
    - PE <> WACI still being considered/discussed
    - CM still kinda taking shape as people bring their use-cases and requirements
        - Martin: e.g. how static are they? cacheable? archival? mutable/dynamic?
        - Brent: Display utility versus query-by-example-like use-cases
12. Verifier Universal Interface (VUI) tracking
    - shooting for beginning of January for work to continue here in C&C
    - exact status unknown, but waiting on 100% clean-IPR before hand-off and work continuing here

5. [WG Participation Tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12hFa574v5PRrKfzIKMgDTjxuU6lvtBhrmLspfKkN4oE/edit#gid=0)
6. Workitem Status: JWS Test Suite (update from Juan)
    - good progress - spruce and msft PRing in testing artefacts and vectors for both JWS signatures and full VC-JWT
    - an upstream spec ambiguity in signature mechanics ("small s /big S" key types from the same curve) see recording for that work item or tracking issues on GH. 
        - since this is strictly upstream and beyond scope, it will just be noted in the JWS test suite docs and a tracking issue opened to monitor for upstream progress or resolution. 
        - possible DIF blog post explaining the ambiguity and suggesting possible resolutions (mandate normalization from the heavens?) forthcoming
8. Workitem Status: WACI-PEX (update from Brent)
    - draft status on the PE portion of WACI-PEx, but hit some blank-node-related roadblocks on low-level BBS+ mechanism that impeded a reference implementation being testable
        - upstream fixes and PRs: hoping to target a future iteration of the signature suite and ref implementation thereof that resolves these glitches and ambiguities
    - Shifting focus to issuance; PRs coming fast already
10. Workitem Status: PE (2.0) + Credential Manifest (update from Brent)
    - OIDF group feedback being folded into PE v2, which has entailed significant discussion and fine-tuning and implementer feedback
    - CM also receiving feedback from implementers towards v1
    - reminder: meeting time organically shifts between 75/25 and 25/75 timeshare between the two work items
12. Workitem Status: VC Marketplace (update from Martin, who recently checked in with )
    - meetings are long-since concluded
    - the WG is going to end with a blog deliverable, which may include a DIF  blog post summarizing a longer Affinidi blog post
14. Verifier Universal Interface (VUI) tracking 
    - somewhat pro-forma IPR mechanics are ongoing to get clean IPR on entirity of donation (which might be the entire VUI or a subset if needed for clean IPR)
    - Work and momentum to continue and focus on integration with other DIF specs (in partic PEx) after ESSIF-LAB spins down and work begins here Jan 2022ish
15. Other topics
    - possibility of other interop profiles being donated (from, say, TIP program at TOIP, or BMWi, or...); debate over hosting them in interop WG, or whether these might require IPR for ongoing work
        - discussion ongoing at Technical Steering Committee

### Recap
#### Status PE
- Closing last issues for an official 0.1.0 transition
- Please raise last-minute issues in person on Thursdays weekly meetings

#### Workitem Proposal Review:
1. [Credential Manifest](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/pull/2) (Kickoff on 12/17)
- Credential Manifest Specification is in unchanged "Strawman" Status since the beginning of the year. Focus has been on the Presentation Exchange workitem.
- With the release of PE 0.1.0 specification, we are "relaunching" the CM spec into official C&C workitem status
- Thursday PE Meetings will transition into regular CM Meeting Specifications
- 7-day objection period for workitem from today's meeting
2. [VC Marketplace](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/pull/1)
- Foused on Use Cases (Outcome is not a specification, but User Journeys)
- Example Use Case:
    - Incentives for the Credential Ecosystem: How can a Marketplace create natural incentive layers for issuing and exchanging verifiable credentials.
    - How can Marketplace layer accelerate the interoperability between different "identity networks"
- Specification will likely generate requirements for existing specs like Presentation Exchange or Credential Manifest
- 7-day objection period for workitem from today's meeting
#### Open Discussion
- Aries RFCs and their Integration of PE and CM specifications.
- Aries-GO plans full support of BBS+ and PE and the end of Q1/2021
- Kunal: Status on Schema Work: Martin will reach out.
